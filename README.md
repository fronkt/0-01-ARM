My Maker project -  video coming to youtube shortly after completion

Hello! My name is Frank Cai and this project is a robotic arm made from 3D printed parts and an Arduino based microcontroller! I bought mostly everything from AliExpress and some things from Amazon. I designed my 3D printed models in Fusion 360, coded in Arduino IDE, and used a robotics textbook to learn more about kinematics etc...

I built it in hopes to learn more about Mechatronics as I am also an intern under an Engineering professor. I chose tho build a robotic arm specifically to get a sense of mechanical, electrical, and the design aspect of making.
