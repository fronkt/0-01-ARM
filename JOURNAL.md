June 20 2025 - 7 hours - Part picking, sketching, and Designing the Base for the arm.

Started off by searching for servos to use. I researched a bit and decided to opt for a 40 kg servo (DS Servo). Began drafting different arm and base designs. I also determined how many links and joints I was going to have. I sketched out some models in my notebook and began to model the base in Fusion when I felt comfortable with my vision. Struggled with picking dimensions and envisioning how big I wanted the arm to be. Opted to make it 2.5 in tall with a diameter of 7 in. I also took an already existing servo mount and remodeled/modified it in order for better support and holes to be screwed in. What took a long time was lining up the holes for screws witht he servo mount holes as I ran into issues regarding moving and joints for some reason outside of my knowledge.

June 21 2025 - 8 hours - Buying the Servo, modeling the base cover, assembly of the base with servo

Decided to buy the servos. I then finished up my servo mount and assembled it with the base. I also designed a cover in order to hide the internal compartments of the base. Started working on the base revolutionary joint thing that would attach to the base servo to the servo moving the first link up and down. This took me a while as I had to think how to draft it and what would structurally work :/.

June 22 2025 - 6 Hours - Servo mount modifications, drafting, sketching

I ran into a bit of an issue at this stage. I had to think how I would be able to attach the base revolutionary joint servo to the link. I began drafting some ideas and searching for inspiration but didn't like what others had came up with. I ended up deciding to go with my idea of using a bearing and modifying the servo mount so the bearing could fit on the other side of the servo arm so it would support the link. I was originally going to try to find a bearing that would work with the original servo mount but there is not many bearings avaliable on AliExpress with an inner diameter of 11 so I decided to redesign it to a smaller diameter. I bought the 11x25x6 bearing and optimized the servo mount to fit (and support the link EQUALLY to the arm). This took ages as it was mostly testing and analyzing the dia and lengths.

June 23 2025 - 12 Hours - 3D printing original servo mount, beginning design of links... (many drafts, many hours, many tears cried)
